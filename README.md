This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.

The purpose of this project is to create a simple and professional online presence to showcase my background, skills, and projects as a Computer Science (Data Science) student.
It serves as a central place for recruiters, collaborators, and other developers to learn about my work.
The portfolio highlights my technical skills, academic background, certifications, and practical projects in data science, analytics, and web development.
It is designed to be clean, easy to navigate, and continuously updated as I learn and build more.
This repository may also be useful for students or beginners who want a simple example of a personal portfolio website.
